## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

For this challenge, I tried to be clean as possible. I also tried the CSS multy-background behing the qrcode. I also set up a timer to be sure to make less than 1 hour.

I'd never use Figma so it was my first time. Pretty easy to use and really helpfull for the size and placement. I also use it to copy style like box shadow because of the very specific properties.
